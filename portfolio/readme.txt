When starting this portfolio assignment, I was a bit concerned. The design seemed way out of my ability to code (at least within a tight timeframe)

I knew that even if I strayed from the original, I wanted to create a website that looked unique and engaging, but still intuitive and user-friendly (which ideally reflects my approach - or desired approach - to design. 
My mockup used several animations that would not be carried through (through lack of time and knowledge of javascript), and I also knew I needed to approach
coding this website a bit differently from designing. I realized I had to scale my expectations and remove some superfluous elements.

A few things I knew I realistically could omit without losing out on the signature aesthetic and functionality of the website:
- decorative background elements;
- animations and states on images/links
- certain buttons and filters (though useful, let's just imagine they work for now)

Things I couldn't imagine sacrificing in my website:
- Back to top button (some of the pages are quite long, and I can't justify endless scrolling) [achieved]
- An always accessible nav menu (fixed position) [achieved]
- Side scrolling elements in mobile [not perfect, but achieved - Hurray!]

A few things that proved easier in html/css than adobe xd were:
- Consistency for sizing.
- That's about it. This was admittedly much more difficult.

I started by creating a "template" page with my mobile/tablet nav and footer, and then my desktop nav and footer (since they were completely different). This was the most challenging part, and took several re-visits once I started adding content to ensure my margins and spacing was correct (especially in desktop mode). 
But once this template was created, I was able to play with the body for each individual page successfully starting with the mobile version and working my way up (leaving the Home page and its animations for last). I really made an effort to find breaking points, and worked with less source set images, but organized 
the layout in a way that I only needed one or two optimized img files. I could have been more efficient in creating classes to avoid re-using so many lines of code for things like text and formatting -- I will keep this in mind for the next project. 

I struggled a bit with some glitches using hover and animation states, so some remain from the mockup and some were removed. Comments are added in the CSS for particularly perplexing things. 

I suspect my desktop side nav became a major culprit to much of my challenges. Who knew z-indexes and margins would be so difficult to keep track of!?

Also, I realized MUCH later that my navigation is not accessible by keyboard, I suspect because the hamburger button I found is nested within an input/button. 
I am still working out how to fix this, but suspect I may need to redo the menus.

Furthermore, here are the links to the interactive mock-up for mobile/desktop (tablet is much the same as mobile), should you might want to compare the interactivity:
